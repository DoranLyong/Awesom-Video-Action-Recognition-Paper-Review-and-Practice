# Dataset Lists & Review 

The following paper lists are what I did or will read, and they might not cover all papers published so far. If you want more paper lists, please refer to the links in the [Statistics](#Statistics) session. If you want more resources, you can refer to the [Papers-With-Code](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?q=action&v=lst&o=match) or the [VisualData](https://visualdata.io/discovery) website. 

The datasets will be categorized depending on each target task: 

* Action Recognition (**AR**)
* Action Prediction (**AP**)
* Temporal Action Proposal (**TAP**)
* Temporal Action Localization/Detection (**TAL/D**)
* Spatiotemporal Action Proposal (**SAP**)
* Spatiotemporal Action Localization/Detection (**SAL/D**)



Or depending on what kind of **actors** and **annotations** :

- actors : 
  - Human (**H**)
  - Non-human (**N**)
- annotations : 
  - Action class (**C**)
  - Temporal markers (**T**)
  - Saptiotemporal bounding boxes/masks (**S**)



(:exclamation:) Papers which I will read soon are marked with  :last_quarter_moon:.
